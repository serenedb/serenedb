SereneDB unifies **Elasticsearch-like search** and **ClickHouse-like analytics** in a single, powerful, **Postgres-compatible** database.

We are building the world’s first distributed, real-time search database — bringing search and analytical processing together for blazing-fast performance and eliminating data duplication. We aim at revolutionizing the traditional search space, by providing consistent search experience with frequent updates and a postgres-compatible layer for ease of use. Our mission is to provide an easy-to-use unified search and analytics solution to change the way applications store and retrieve their data.
