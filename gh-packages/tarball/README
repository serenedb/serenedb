SereneDB
--------

In order to use a tar installation simply add the `@SERENEDB_PACKAGE_NAME@/bin`
directory to your path.

For bash, use

    unix> export PATH="/full/path/to/unpacked/@SERENEDB_PACKAGE_NAME@/bin:$PATH"

If you have additionally installed serenedb as Debian or RPM package,
you need to ensure that `@SERENEDB_PACKAGE_NAME@` comes first in the PATH
variable. Otherwise the binaries from the installed `serenedb` package
will be used and not the ones from the tar file.


Use (the simplest example for server)

    serened /tmp/mydata

where `/tmp/mydata` should point to the directory containing the
data.
