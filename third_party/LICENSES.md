## Programs

### Bison

* Project Home: https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/
* License Comment: only used to generate code, not part of the distribution;
  for details about using Bison in this way see
  http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/manual/bison.html#Conditions

  As a special exception, you may create a larger work that contains part or
  all of the Bison parser skeleton and distribute that work under terms of your
  choice, so long as that work isn't itself a parser generator using the
  skeleton or a modified version thereof as a parser skeleton. Alternatively,
  if you modify or redistribute the parser skeleton itself, you may (at your
  option) remove this special exception, which will cause the skeleton and the
  resulting Bison output files to be licensed under the
  GNU General Public License without this special exception.

### Flex

* Project Home: https://github.com/westes/flex
* License Comment: free as-is license (BSD-2-Clause variant),
  only used to generate code, not part of the distribution

### cmake

* Project Home: https://cmake.org/
* License: BSD 3-clause "New" or "Revised" License
